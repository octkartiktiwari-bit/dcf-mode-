# DCF Valuation Model (Excel + Python)

## Project Overview
This repository contains a traditional Excel-based Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation model and its Python implementation for automation and scalability.

## Excel DCF Model
The Excel file (`Excel_DCF_Model.xlsx`) follows a standard DCF valuation structure:

- Base year free cash flow input
- Multi-year cash flow projections using assumed growth rates
- Discounting projected cash flows using WACC
- Terminal value calculation using the Gordon Growth Model
- Enterprise value and intrinsic value estimation

## Python Implementation
The Python model replicates the same logic used in the Excel DCF model, allowing faster scenario analysis and reduced manual errors.

## How to Use
1. Open the Excel file to review assumptions and valuation logic.
2. Run the Python script/notebook to generate the valuation programmatically.

## Key Assumptions
- Growth rate
- Discount rate (WACC)
- Terminal growth rate
